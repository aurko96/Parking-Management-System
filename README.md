# Parking Management System

This software allows the user to park their vehicles in a systematic way in the parking lot by assigning a parking slot provided they insert the Vehicle Bluebook. 
The users receive a parking ticket at the time of parking and while leaving they receive a cash memo generated by the system in which they have to pay their parking bill. 
This parking bill is generated depending upon the time the car is parked and the type of vehicle. Based on the vehicle class, parking is alloted at the vacant spot.

**Code Implementation:**

* Java FX has been used to build the GUI of our parking management system
* There are three types of codes used to build the project which are â€“ Java Fx, FXML, CSS.
* The FXML codes builds the whole outlook and basic structure of our system
* The Java code is used for executing different methods of different classes
* The CSS code is used for designing and coloring the whole system
